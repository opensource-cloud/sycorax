# Sycorax

**It is under development**

Sycorax is a queue service written in Golang that is designed to be fast, powerful, resilient, and scalable.

It leverages Golang's built-in support for concurrency and memory management to achieve high performance and throughput.

Sycorax is also designed to be highly resilient, with features such as message replication and automatic failover to ensure that messages are never lost or dropped.

Additionally, Sycorax is highly scalable, allowing it to handle large volumes of messages and grow with your application's needs. With its combination of speed, power, resilience, and scalability, Sycorax is an excellent choice for building robust and reliable async services.
